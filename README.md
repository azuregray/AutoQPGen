## **`DEPLOYMENT & USAGE`**
> 1️⃣ **Step 01**: Please visit the Original Repository [**`AutoQPGen`**](https://github.com/azuregray/AutoQPGen) and find the Green `CODE` button and click on "Downlaoad ZIP"

> 2️⃣ **Step 02**: Extract the downloaded `AutoQPGen-main.zip` file into its folder and move into the same.

> 3️⃣ **Step 03**: Once you are in the root folder, Install the requirements. Take the help of `requirements.txt`, just run this in Terminal `Interpreter: PowerShell`:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> 4️⃣ **Step 04**: Install `wkhtmltopdf` from their Downloads page - [**`wkhtmltox`**](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html/) and download the appropriate installer (Windows 64-bit for Windows machines and so on). For windows, the downloaded file must look something like `wkhtmltox-...-win64.exe` 

> 5️⃣ **Step 05**: After installing the WKHTMLTOX setup file in Step 04, you need to add its binaries to System PATH. Normally this should happen automatically. Just to confirm.

> 6️⃣ **Step 06**: Once that is successful, finally run `app.py` in Terminal `Interpreter: PowerShell`:
```
python ./app.py
```

> 7️⃣ **Step 07**: After running the command in `Step 06`, please do a `Ctrl + Click` on the localhost URL where the service is being hosted, which is generated in the same terminal windows running `app.py`. For example: `https://127.0.0.1:5000`

### **`KNOWN ISSUE`**
> We have noticed that there is a general bug in PyMuPDF library which can give the following error: `Attribute Error : fitz has no attribute open()`. Since fitz is just a wrapper for PyMuPDF library, this error can be fixed easily by force-reinstalling PyMuPDF with the following command in your Terminal  `Interpreter: PowerShell`:
```
python -m pip install --force-reinstall pymupdf
```
